## About
This repository contains the GameLogic class, an essential component of a dice game made with using help from an AI (ChatGPT). The class provides methods for rolling dice and calculating scores based on the outcomes of the rolls. It is designed to handle various scenarios in dice gaming, such as scoring straights, sets of similar dice, and individual dice values.
